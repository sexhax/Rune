# Rune - A Fun Discord Selfbot

Hey there! Rune is a lightweight and feature-packed selfbot for Discord, built in Go. It's designed to add some useful tools, silly fun, and even a bit of edge to your Discord experience—all running from your own account.

**Important Warning**: Selfbots like this go against Discord's Terms of Service. If you use it, there's a real risk of your account getting banned. I'm not responsible for anything that happens—use it at your own risk, and maybe on a throwaway account if you're just testing.

## What Can It Do?

Rune comes with a bunch of commands, grouped into categories. The default prefix is `&`, but you can change it.
